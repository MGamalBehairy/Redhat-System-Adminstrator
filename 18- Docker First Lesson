  3- Portability 


ٍso Containers are: Isolated Environment that Provides the need of running the App (All Dependencies, Libraries, binary files,  Configuration)
                   ,  so you have  ONE OS  and run multiple Applications "Maybe Same Apps" on it,  without any conflicts,      and the Kernel is Shared among the Containers
