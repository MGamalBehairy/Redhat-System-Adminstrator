 Port MApping:- to make the User/Client access the Container, through the IP:PORT  of  NIC  of  Server



Network Drivers:
  1- Bridge              =>  Containers CAN      go outside the Host,            and Containers  Can Communicate with each other
  2- Host                =>  Containers Can NOT go Outside the Host,             ~ ~        ~ ~        ~ ~            ~ ~
  3- Null/None           => Just Locally
  4- mac vlan            => make every Container as an Isolated Physical Machine,  the Containers will see itelf as a physical machine not just Container,  also the Clients


  docker network  --help
  docker network prune                              => "Remove unused Networks"
                 inspect  "ContainerName"
                 rm                                 =>  "Remove Network"
                 connect                            =>  "Connect a Container to Network"
                 create                             =>  " Create Network"
                 inspect                            =>    "Display detailed information about network"


===> Create Network:-
$ docker network create "net1" --driver bridge --subnet 10.0.0.0/24  --gateway 10.0.0.1

$ docker network inspect net1
==> assign Container to Ceratn NETOWRK
$ docker run -d --restart always --name lab2 --network  net1  httpd

==> Disconnect Container From Netowrk
$ docker network disconnect net1 lab2
==> to Connect to Network
$ docker network connect net1 lab2

$ docker netwro inspect net1        => "in the output, u will see "lab2" is attached to "net1"  " 
Note:   the Image name must be come at the END of the COMMAND  "docker run --name httpd"


-----------------------------------------------  Port Mapping  ----------------------------------------
$  -p  90:80        (90 on host,    80 for Containers)

$ docker run -d --restart always --name lab2  --network net1  -p 90:80  httpd                   (the output  =>   0.0.0.0:90->80    "0.0.0.0  means  any Request comming for any NIC ")
                                                              -p 192.168.1.77:90:80 httpd      (now you specified the IP of the HOST )
