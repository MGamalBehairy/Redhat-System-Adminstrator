Container is An Isolated Environment with " Service  &  DATA "

and the Data in the Container is "EPHEMERAL"
when delete the container, the data on it also removed
so here we need the "docker Volume"  هنا ظهرت الحاجة الي docker volume
- also the data of container is "ONLY Accessable" when Container is Running




MicroServices  Concept  :-    the app devided into mullitple Services,  and every Service assign for isolated Container,    but All containers  can communicate with each other, and share data between them



Summary:  
Volume is Central Location OR External Storage outside the Container  ,  and we needed this becuase the Data of Containers were EPHEMERAL ,  only accessable if the container running ,  and if the containers removed , the data will also removed.
                                    and the Container will go to the Volume to access or get Data,  so now the Containers will hold the Service NOT Data
