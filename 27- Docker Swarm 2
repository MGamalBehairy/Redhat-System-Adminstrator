1- Connect all VMs together

$ sudo vm /etc/hosts        ==> Resolve "Convert the name of host to IP"

$ docker swarm --help  (we will find that "Swarm" is Exist but Not Active)

==> Activate sarm and initialize "Cluster Pool"
$ docker swarm init --help

$ docker swarm init --advertise-addr 

$ docker swarm init --advertise-addr  ens33

# You will see that he is telling "to join a node to cluster run the following command ,  and if you want to join manager to cluster run the following command"

$ docker swarm join-token manager

$ docker swarm join  --token  ..................... (the command that he gave u)

===>  To list All Nodes in the Cluster  (The Workers OR Managers)
$ docker node ls

===> To create "Container" Using Swarm
Old way  => $ docker run -d --restart always --name test1 -p 90:80 -- network net1 -v type=volume httpd
New Way  => $ docker service create -d --name containerSwarm    --replicas 3   httpd                                ==>  "Note: We can Set number Of Replicas"

$ docker ps       => output,  containerSwarm.3    => "3" is tht number of Replicas

===>  scale umber of Replicas for Container
$ docker service scale "Container Name"=5

===> List Info of Container
$ docker service ps "containerName"
