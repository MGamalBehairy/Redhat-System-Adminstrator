Docker Copose : is a tool Produced by Docker File written in "Yaml" Language,   to  Manage More than One Container at the same time Related to the Same App  , also  & Manage Volumes & Netowrks
              to Link 2 Related Containers together

first u need to name it :" docker-compose.yml"

$ vim docker-compose.yml

version: "3"
services:
  app-db:            (container 1)
  container_name: app-db
  image: mariadb
  ports:
    -  "3306:3306"
  restart: always
  environment: 
    -  MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=123
    -  MARIADB_USER=
    -  MARIADB_PASSWORD=123
    -  MARIADB_DATABASE=
  networks:
    -  app_net                                    (it's not exist, so we need to create it)

networks:                      (To create Netowrks)
  -  app_net
    driver:  bridge

  web_app:                      (container 2)
    container_name: web_app
    restart: always
    image: wordpress
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    environmet:
    -  WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=app_db         (cocntainer 1)
    depends_on: app_db                          (don't run until  app_dp is running first)



$ docker compose up      (look for file called "docker-compose.yml"   and execute all instructions on it)


# Docker compose   implement  the "Micro-services" consept,   many containers work together and connected to each other,   depends_on    tell container not running until the other contaier  running first

Docker compose   used  to Manage More than one container At the same Time
