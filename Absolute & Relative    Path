Absolute path      => is the full Path from root Directory ( / )

soft Link     is a shortcut or Sympolic    like shortcut in windows      very small size that point to the original file (which is HARD LINK)   NOT Actual Data on the Hard Disk
Hard Link      same as Orignal File  with same Inode  and same Size  and it points to the Actual Data on The Hard Disk
https://prnt.sc/1PwgvvC-O0B2


To create Hard Link   use   "ln" command hard Link is the same with Orignal file and Acutal Data, same size , same Inode, same permission,   and every time you create a hard link from a file ,  this will increement by one
$ ln /etc/passwd  hardLink-passwd.txt

SOFT Link or Sympolic Link  is a shortcut Link,   the command is like Hard Link   but with adding  " -s "
$ ln -s  /ets/passwd    softLink-passwd.txt

to show the inode number
$ ls -li                        i => for inode

NOTE:  if you deleted the Original Link then the Soft Link will be Useless ,

Also  Hard Link Can Create Only Files not Directories,     but Soft Link can be made from Directory

$ ln /etc  HardLinkDirectory            => hard link NOT Allowed

$ ln -s /etc SoftLink                    => Soft Link Created Successfuly




also  Hard Link can Not be created from  file System OR Partition   to Different Partition
u can't make a hard link    from    /boot   to /home                        becuase these are two different Partitions

but u can make Soft Link From partiton to Different Partion



Summary
Soft Link            => is an Alias to the Original File  similar to the shortcut in Windows
Hard Link            => is the EXACT Replica of the Original file 

Soft Link            => it just Contain the Location to the Original file but NOT the Actal Data
Hard Link            => It Contains the  Actual Content of the File

Soft Link            => have Different Inode Values 
Hard Link            => have SAME Inode Values,  Same Size, Same Permissions,   Same  Time Stamp (Access / Modification)

Soft Link            => the Link becomes Inaccessible when the original file is removed
Hard Link            => Changes in the Hard Linked File will reflect in the other Files

Soft Link            =>  can Be created Every where across filesystem in different partitions,  also can be created from Directories
Hard Link            => Links Can NOT be created in Different Partitions for Ex.  /dev /home ...    also can't create Directory

Soft Link            => Can Link both to a File or a DIRECTORY
Hard Link            => Hard Links can Only link to a File   ,  NOT a Directory
