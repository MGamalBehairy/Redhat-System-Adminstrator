grep   => get the word or pattern you are looking for from the file     and give you the line which this word exist

EX.

$grep mohamed /etc/passwd


NOTE;   grep   is Case Sensitive by Default

$ grep ROOT /etc/passwd      => ROOT Doesn't Exist

so to ignore case sensitive => use   -i   

$ grep -i  ROOT  /etc/passwd


-v option   =>  get All lines  that Dones't contain the pattern u give      ,   so its like the opposite of the grep
Ex.
$ grep -v nologin  /etc/passwd


-A 1..9..  (A => After)    => display the pattern  and "number"  of lines After it
$ grep -A 2 root  /etc/passwd
=>>> it will give u the line that contain "root" and also 2 lines after this line


-B 1..9  (B ==> Before)  => display number of lines before the line that contain the pattern

$ grep -B 2 root  /etc/passwd





-r    => recursive    => search for the pattern in all sub-directories and sub-files
هيدور علي الكلمة اللي انت عايزها  في كل الملفات والفولدرات  في المسار اللي انت مدهوله


-e    => search for PATTERN1 OR  Pattern2

$ grep -e  mohamed  -e  root  /etc/passwd          // search for  "mohamed" OR  "root"   in /etc/passwd
Another way
$ grep "mohamed|root"  /etc/passwd



^    => any word starts with the pattern after "^"
Ex.
grep ^cat  /usr/share/dict/words
      output  =>> catupa  , catra,....     all words start with "cat"

$  => any words ENDS  with the pattern Before "$"
Ex.
grep cat$  /usr/share/dict/words
    output  =>> natcat,  pascat ...   all words ends with "cat"
