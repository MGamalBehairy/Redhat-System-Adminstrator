-----------------------------------------------        How to Write Script        ----------------------------------
1- Know the Shell you use
$ echo $SHELL

create file.sh
1- wrie  #!  (Magic Shebang)      /path/to/"shell" (bash)        /

Benefits of "Magic Shebang":-      
        1)  Define the Shell that u will use in Script
        2)  Open Shell in the Background  and run the Script on it (in the Background)  and the Result the come from Backround ,  go to Foreground
                 so the result that will be shown in the Foreground will be as a "Text" NOT "output",        so if u run command like "ls"   the result will be not Colored
                 and if u want to color it,  u must use --color option  (it says like get show the result in the foreground with the Real Color"Brig the result with the  color)
